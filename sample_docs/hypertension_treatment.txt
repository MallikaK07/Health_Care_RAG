Title: Evidence-Based Approaches to Hypertension Treatment
Source: Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) 2024

Abstract:
Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and chronic kidney disease, affecting approximately 1.28 billion adults worldwide. Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive therapies, global blood pressure control rates remain suboptimal. This review summarizes current evidence-based strategies for hypertension management.

1. Classification and Targets:
Blood pressure is classified as normal (< 120/80 mmHg), elevated (120-129/< 80 mmHg), stage 1 hypertension (130-139/80-89 mmHg), and stage 2 hypertension (>= 140/90 mmHg). The recommended treatment target for most adults is < 130/80 mmHg. For older adults (>= 65 years) with a high burden of comorbidities, a systolic blood pressure target of < 130 mmHg is reasonable if tolerated.

2. Non-Pharmacological Interventions:
Lifestyle modifications are the foundation of hypertension management. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products while reducing sodium intake to < 2,300 mg/day (ideally < 1,500 mg/day), can reduce systolic blood pressure by 8-14 mmHg. Regular aerobic exercise (at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity) can lower blood pressure by 5-8 mmHg. Weight reduction in overweight or obese individuals reduces blood pressure by approximately 1 mmHg per kg of weight lost. Limiting alcohol consumption and smoking cessation are also recommended.

3. First-Line Pharmacological Therapies:
Four classes of antihypertensive medications are recommended as first-line therapy: ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs; losartan, valsartan, olmesartan), calcium channel blockers (CCBs; amlodipine, nifedipine), and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide). Initial therapy with two first-line agents from different classes is recommended for patients with stage 2 hypertension or blood pressure > 20/10 mmHg above target.

4. Special Populations:
For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to their renoprotective effects. Beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol) are recommended for hypertensive patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or prior myocardial infarction. For African American patients without CKD, initial therapy with a CCB or thiazide diuretic is preferred due to better blood pressure response.

5. Resistant Hypertension:
Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure remaining above goal despite the use of three antihypertensive agents at optimal doses, including a diuretic. Evaluation should include screening for secondary causes (primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, obstructive sleep apnea) and assessment of medication adherence. Spironolactone is the recommended fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension.

6. Monitoring:
Patients initiating or adjusting antihypertensive therapy should be seen at 1-month intervals until blood pressure is at goal. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) are valuable tools for confirming the diagnosis, detecting white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, and assessing treatment response.
